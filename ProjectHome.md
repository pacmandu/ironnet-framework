IronNet Framework is an extensive network security tool meant to help automate and centralize network assessments in the hopes of allowing even beginners to cooperate in a community driven tool. It is essentially a wrapper tool that combines our standard tools (nmap, metasploit, aircrack, etc.) in an easy to use environment/interface where the tools can share their output between themselves and help generate reports. So far it is written entirely in bash to help beginners understand scripting/security and to allow others to make additions and changes to match whatever skill level or environment that they might be in. It has a module based system where a security professional can write their own modules in their preferred language and still have the tool operate (as long as the language can read shell environment variables and we are also working on a file the modules can reference as well). So, in short, it is a modular security tool that helps centralize and manage pentests with all the tools we use and can have multiple people working on the same database of targets at the same time remotely(server/client functionality is built in and traffic is encrypted) and allow you to use which ever programming language you prefer. This description may change in the future to incorporate all the features that IronNet has to offer and future updates.
